# Slack-App
The Slack app called Going-Merry has an interactive homepage with multiple screens. It can send messages upon certain triggers. It detects the command '/ticket' which opens up a modal with interactive buttons. It can detect messages the users send and can respond to them accordingly and dynamically. It can save into and read messages from a database using slack channel's chats.
